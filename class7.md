# More Javascript

So far, it's all about functions in Javascript.

A function is a set of rules, and you can write as many as you want without affecting your code, as you can link or "reference" your functions (rules) to anywhere you want to in your html files.

> ex. function yourTitle() {}

In these functions live the "rules" and they're written within the {} symbols

> ex. function yourTitle() {
    rules rules rules rules
}

These rules can be all manner of things. The options are vast, dareisay limitless.

Once a function is live on the internet, you can even add a neat function called a "console" to "log" what your code does right on a live browser. Its a great way to keep track of how your code behaves, or misbehaves, in real time.

> ex. function yourTitle() {
    console.log ("yourTitle());
}

This funtion can then be placed anywhere in your html file by referencing it using a html ref code called a "script"

> ex. script document.write(yourTitle()) script

ps. You would need appropriate tags at the begining and end of your script for it to be formated correctly and work as intended.

Using these tools, you can make a website more inviting and fun for a user, which is the whole point right?
