# CSS Intro

> How does it work?

Html is what you might call the skeleton of a website. The structure. The bones.
It holds everything you want to share, but nothing else.

There is no scenery, nothing to grab your attention, nothing pleasing to the eye.

This is where CSS comes into play.
Together, html and css have created every page you've ever seen on the internet.

From beatiful backgrounds, vibrant pictures, inspiring videos, text and words that can mirror a rainbow,
there is no limit of what you can do with html and css... you simply need to learn the rules.

> What are the rules?

Simply put, there are far too many rules to remember.

The trick is to find a good text editor like, Visual Studio Code, and use the tools given to make the process less strenuous.

Some commands you are sure to use include:

- margin
- padding
- border
- color
- background-color
- height
- width

... and to specify where you want these commands to happen, you'll need to reference where in you html file you want them to affect:

- html
- body
- h1
- ul
- li
- main
- h2
- header
- footer

... and so on and so forth

It takes repetition to truly gain a firm grasp of how to make a barebones project elegant and grand.

Here is my hand at such a feat. Enjoy!
